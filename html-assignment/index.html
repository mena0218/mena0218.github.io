        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I grew up with the world of video games and the casual passion my father has towards motorsports. They've captured my imagination and still do to this day. When I look at video games, I see a canvas that I can interact with and when I watch F1, I see some of the bravest men challenge themselves against each other around some of the most beautiful circuits in the world.</p>
                <blockquote>"No matter how many times we fail, no matter how far we fall, in the end you are still worthy" <em>-Finn</em></blockquote>
                <p>I may not like books, but I love stories and immersing myself in a believable living breathing world. As I grew older, my field of interest turned to psychology and video editing. I strive to always be there to help people with anything that is in my power.</p>
